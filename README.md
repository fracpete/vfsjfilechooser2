vfsjfilechooser2
================

vfsjfilechooser2 is a mavenized fork of the dormant vfsjfilechooser project on
sf.net (https://sourceforge.net/projects/vfsjfilechooser/).

It is an alternative to Java's JFileChooser Swing component, which does not
suffer from the JFileChooser's infamous "freezes" on Windows
(http://bugs.sun.com/view_bug.do?bug_id=6372808).

It has been updated to work with version 2.0 of the VFS Apache commons and
includes a few bugfixes and enhancements. 

Developers of the original project:
